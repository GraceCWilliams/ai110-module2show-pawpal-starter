# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

Before drafting the UML, I identified three core actions a user should be able to perform in PawPal+:

1. **Enter owner and pet information.** The user sets up a basic profile: the owner's name and how much time they have for pet care each day, plus the pet's name, species or breed, and any special needs. The scheduler needs this context to know whose plan it is building and what time limit it has to work within.

2. **Add and edit care tasks.** The user creates the care tasks their pet needs, such as walks, feeding, medication, enrichment, or grooming. Each task has at least a duration and a priority level. A task can also have a preferred time of day or say how often it repeats. The user can update or remove tasks as their routine changes.

3. **Generate and view today's plan.** The user asks the app to build a daily schedule. The app orders tasks by priority, fits them into the owner's available time, and leaves out or flags any task that doesn't fit. It then shows the plan in time order with a short explanation of why each task was placed where it was.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
